# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT #

This project is a simple and fun quiz app built Initially on **CodePen** to quickly test its performance and functionality. Later, the final version was developed in **Visual Studio Code** for better organization. The app is created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to provide an interactive and engaging quiz experience.  

The quiz presents multiple-choice questions, and if a user selects the wrong answer, the correct one is highlighted before moving to the next question. It also includes a **2-minute timer**, so users have to answer quickly. The background color changes with each question to keep things visually interesting. At the end, a **celebration effect with sparkles** appears, and the user is shown their **final score** along with the correct answers.  

**JavaScript** handles the quiz logic, including button clicks, score updates, and animations. **CSS animations** add smooth transitions, such as a **card throw effect** when switching between questions. The final score page is designed to be clear and easy to read, ensuring users can see their performance at a glance. The quiz is also **responsive**, meaning it works well on different devices.  

This project can be used in **education, training, online tests, or just for fun**. Teachers can use it in classrooms, companies can use it for employee assessments, and it can even be adapted for trivia games. Since it was first developed on **CodePen**, it was easy to experiment with different features, and moving to **Visual Studio Code** made it easier to structure and refine the final version. Future improvements could include adding difficulty levels, different categories, or even multiplayer features to make it even more interactive.
